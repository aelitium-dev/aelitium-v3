# Documentation System

## Source of Truth
- Repo (Git): authoritative for architecture + governance + threat model + procedures.

## Obsidian
- Personal/work notes only. Not authoritative. May reference repo paths/commits.

## Notion
- Coordination/project management only. Not authoritative. Must link to repo documents.

## Rule
If repo doc and external doc diverge: repo wins. External docs must be updated to match repo.
