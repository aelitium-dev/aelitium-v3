# Phase 4 — 7-Day Feedback Loop (Canonical)

Goal: validate product option(s) without governance drift.

Every week:
- 5 conversations (ICP targets)
- 2 demos (determinism + tamper + authority verify)
- 1 decision (continue/kill/pivot) logged in Notion and mirrored here as a short note

Rule:
- No claims are "official" unless mirrored in this repo.
