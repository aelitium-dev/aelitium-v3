## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Report privately to: **secure@aelitium.com**

Include:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Affected version(s)
- Impact assessment if known

We aim to acknowledge within **72 hours** and provide a resolution timeline within **7 days**.

## Scope

This policy covers:
- `engine/` — canonicalization, signing, pack/verify/repro
- `engine/ai_cli.py` — CLI surface
- Cryptographic guarantees (Ed25519 signing, SHA-256 integrity)

Out of scope: demo fixtures, test files, documentation errors.

## Cryptographic primitives

- Signing: Ed25519 via Python `cryptography` library
- Hashing: SHA-256 (stdlib `hashlib`)
- Canonicalization: deterministic JSON (sorted keys, UTF-8, no whitespace)
